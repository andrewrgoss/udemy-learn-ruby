# The count method on a string returns the number of occurances of what
# we provide as a substring - an argument which we give to the count method.
puts 'Hello world'.count('l') # "l" occurs 3 times in this string
puts 'Hello world'.count('lo') # we get 5 times in here as Ruby counts

# the occurances of "l" and "o" together so we have 3 times "l" and 2 times
# "o" which gives us 5.
puts 'An amazing aardvark appeared.'.count('Aa')

# Task 1:
# Return the number of total times the search characters are in the string.
# My solution:
def custom_count(string, search_character)
  string.count(search_character)
end
p custom_count('Rebecca', 'cca')

# Boris' solution:
def custom_count_1(string, search_character)
  count = 0
  string.each_char { |char| count += 1 if search_character.include?(char) }
  count
end
p custom_count_1('An amazing aardvark appeared.', 'amazing')
