# INTRO TO MODULES:
#
# What is a module?
# - A module is a toolbox or container of methods and constants.
# - Module methods or constants can be used as needed.
# - Modules create namespaces for the methods with the same name.
# - Modules cannot be used to create instances.
# - Modules can be mixed into classes to add behavior.
#
# Syntax and Style:
# - Module names are written in UpperCamelCase.
# - Constants in module should be written in ALL CAPS.
# - Access module methods with the dot operator (.).
# - Access module constants with the :: symbol.
# - The :: symbol is called the scope resolution operator. We use it to extract
#   a specific constant from a module. It determines the scope - it says
#   in what environment am I going to be looking for this constant?
#

module LengthConversions # in here it is a toolbox of 3 methods
  # we can e.g. implement this module in any other program
  WEBSITE = 'https://www.angelo.edu/dept/agriculture/faculty/scott_conversions.php'.freeze

  def self.miles_to_feet(miles) # we want to call this method on self
    # This self keyword defines this method on the module such that we can say
    # LengthConversions.miles_to_feet and have access to this module later in the
    # program. Using self keyword is the same as writing LengthConversions.miles_to_feet
    # but the reason we don't do it is that e.g. if the name of the module changes later
    # we will have to go through the whole code looking for this module name to change it.
    # If we use self, we won't have to do that.
