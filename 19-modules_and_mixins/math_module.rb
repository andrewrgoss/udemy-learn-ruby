#!/usr/bin/env ruby

# apart from creating custom modules, Ruby has also built-in ones. Some of them
# have to be called to the file by require command, and some of them are
# imported automatically e.g. math module is automatically available. It gives
# us the access to a bunch of constants and methods relating to the various
# methematical functionalities.

# to access the constant:
puts Math::PI

# to access the method:
puts Math.sqrt(9) # square root af a number
puts Math.sin(90)
