# A mixin is simply a module added to a class. Whenever we define a class
# and we want to add a certain functionality to it, we can do that in a form
# of a module whose methods and constants are made available to that class.
#
# WHY MIX IN MODULES TO CLASSES:
# - Different classes need similar functionalities.
# - For example, String and Numeric both need <, <=, >, >= and ==.
# - However, neither class can be represented as the subclass of the other.
# - Duplication of methods across classes violates the DRY princple.
#
# E.g. Numeric and String have some functionalities in common but we cannot
# model the relationship between these two objects. They are just not the same
# thing. What we can do is to define this comparable functionality in a separate
# module and then mix or add that module to this class definition. That way, we
# only need to write the module once but it is allowed to be used in object
# created from either of these two classes. Ruby's comparable module is built-in
# by default so we can use it in our custom clases.
#
class OlympicMedal
  # Comparable built-in module will allow us to perform the following operations:
  # <, <=, >, >=, == and between? but we need to clarify Ruby what exactly we want
  # to compare. In order to do that we have to define the method using the
  # spaceship operator.
  include Comparable # importing built-in comparable module; if we include it in
  # the method, we need to define the spaceship operator method or sth similar
  # so that Ruby knows what and how to compare objects.
