# a multidimensional array is an array containing other arrays together
users = [['Bob', 25, 'Male'], ['Susan', 48, 'Female'], ['Larry', 62, 'Male']]

p users[1] # we get back the whole nested array as it is treated as one element
# with the index position no. 1
p users[1][2] # this extracts the element with index position no. 2 from the array
# with index position no. 1

# to unpack a multidimensional array we simply assign it to so many elements as
# it contains. We put these elements on the left and already defined "users"
# variable on the right then we output all variables (see the runner window)
