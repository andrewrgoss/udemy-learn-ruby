:name # name represents a Symbols
p :name
p :name.class
p :name.methods # returns all methods available on a symbol
p :name.methods.length # returns the exact number of methods available
# on a Symbol
'name'
p 'name'
p 'name'.class

p 'name'.methods.length # 170 methods available on a string while 79 available
# on a symbol - that is why a symbol takes less space in the memory
