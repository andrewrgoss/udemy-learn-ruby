#  - A hash or a hash map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs.
#  - Hashes are called dictionaries, maps or associative arrays in other
#    programming languages.
#  - A hash object connects unique identifiers (keys) to values.
#
#  # Rules of the hash:
#  - hash keys and hash values can be objects of any type
#  - hash keys must be unique (no duplicates)
#  - hash values can contain duplicates
#  - hashes should be treated as unordered. Values are extracted by their key,
#   not by their order.
#
#   A hash is made in Ruby with {}.
