# Variables are just placeholders, the name of the object is not a phone
# or laptop. Phone or laptop are just the labels/placeholders we've given to it.
# We have no clue what the users are going to use as their variables so self keyword
# within this to_s definition basically says "this object". This object that
# has the to_s method on it. Self is tricky and sometimes it will not refer to
# the object e.g when used outside the instance method (outside the instance
# method it will refer to the class itself).
