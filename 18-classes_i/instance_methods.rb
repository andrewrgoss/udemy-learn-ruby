# When we define instance method on a class, we define some kind of functionality,
# we define some kind of message that we can send to the object and tell it
# to do something. Instance methods are not shared between objects rather
# whenever an instance or an object is created each method is copied from
# the class definition to that specific object. The class is just the blueprint
# that says here is how you can process that message. When we call the method,
# we send it exclusively to a specific object.

# info method cannot be called on its own like any other method. It can be
# called only on a Gadget object as it belongs to objects, it does not exist
# separately. It needs a method on which it can be called. That object is called
# the receiver as it receives the method call.
# the info method has been added to the methods list that are available
# on the Gadget objects. See the runner:
puts phone.methods.sort

puts phone.methods - Object.methods # we get the method defined by us, it is
# not inherited from the Object class
