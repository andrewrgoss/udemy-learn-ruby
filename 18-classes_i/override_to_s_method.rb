# we can override this .to_s method that is inherited from the Object class
# by defining our own to_s custom method within our class body. If we call a
# given method, Ruby looks for it in the class methods first and then in the
# methods that are inherited. That is why our to_s method is going to be taken
# first as when Ruby finds our Gadget class to_s method it won't look any further.
