# THE .CLASS METHOD ON OBJECTS:
#  - Objects receive their structure or design from classes.
#  - The .class method returns the class the object was constructed from.
#  - The object's class is itself another object.
# THE .SUPERCLASS METHOD ON CLASSES:
#  - A superclass is the class that a current class inherits from.
#   Inheritance follows an "is-a" structure.
#  - The .superclass method is called on a class. It returns the parent
#   class that the current class inherits from.
#  - The class that inherits from the superclass is called the subclass.
#  - Every class in Ruby (except BasicObject at the top of the hierarchy)
#   has at least one superclass.

#
# THE .ANCESTORS METHOD ON CLASSES:
#  - A superclass is the class that a current class inherits from.
#  - The .ancestors method can be called on a class. It returns an array of all
#   superclasses that the class inherts from.
