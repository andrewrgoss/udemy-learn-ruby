#
# INSTANCE VARIABLES:
# - Instance variables are variables that belong to a specific object.
# - Instance variables define the object's properties or attributes.
# - The instance varables make up the object's state.
# - Each object can have a custom state.
# - The state of an object can change over time.
#
# DEFINE AN INSTANCE VARIABLE:
# - Instance variables begin with the @ symbol (e.g. @name).
# - The @ symbol is called a SIGIL, a special character that denotes
#  the variable's scope.
# - Without the @ sigil, the variable would be interpreted as a local variable
#  to the method it is used in.
#
#  @name = "Boris"
#  @age = 25
#
# THE INITIALIZE METHOD:
# - The initialize method is called immediately when an object is instantiated
#  from a class with the new method.
# - The initialize method offers an opportunity to assign values to instance
#  variables in order to define the object's state.
# - If the initialize method is not defined in the class, each object is
#  initialized with no state (like the Gadget objects in the previous lessons)
# - the assignement of values to instance variables does not mean the values
#  have to stay constant. The object's state can be altered later.
class Gadget
  def initialize
    @username = "User#{rand(1..100)}"
    @password = 'topsecret'
    @production_number = "#{('a'..'z').to_a.sample}-#{rand(1..199)}"
  end
end
phone = Gadget.new
laptop = Gadget.new
# whenever a new object is created with the .new method the initialize method
# is going to run automatically and all the new object will be set with
# the instance variables
puts phone
puts phone.inspect
p phone
p laptop
# if we call instance_variables method on the object, it returns all instance
# variables the object has:
p phone.instance_variables
p laptop.instance_variables
