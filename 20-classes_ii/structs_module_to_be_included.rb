# A struct represents a miniclass with less functonality than a typical Ruby class.
# It is like a class with only instance variables. It is used when we only need
# a framework for an object.

module AppStore
  App = Struct.new(:name, :developer, :version) # as argument we provide symbols
  # representing instance variables on this struct

  # defining a constant:
  APPS = [App.new(:Chat, :facebook, 2.0),
          App.new(:Twitter, :twitter, 5.8),
          App.new(:Weather, :yahoo, 10.15)].freeze
  def self.find_app(name)
    APPS.find { |app| app.name == name }
