# Protected methods fall somewhere in the middle of the private and public
# methods.
#
# Review of Methods:
# - Public methods allow interaction with an object.
# - Public methods can be called by any other object.
# - Private methods can only be called within an object.
# - Private methods cannot be invoked by another object.
# - Private methods cannot be called with an explicit receiver (the object
#  that is getting the command or a method) - only the current
#  object is able to receive the method.
#
# What is a protected method?
# - Protected methods can be invoked only by the objects of the same class.
# - Protected methods can be called within the same family of objects.
# - Protected methods are used to compare objects of the same class; they can be
#  accessed by other class objects.

class Car
  def initialize(age, miles)
    base_value = 20_000
    age_deduction = age * 1000
    miles_deduction = (miles / 10.to_f)
    @value = base_value - age_deduction - miles_deduction
  end

  def compare_car_with(car)
    value > car.value ? 'Your car is better' : 'Your car is worse'
  end
  # we don't use the attr_reader in here as we don't want to expose the car value

  protected

  attr_reader :value
end

civic = Car.new(3, 3000)
# p civic.value # we can't call it as we get an error in here as the method
# is protected. We can't access it outside of the object. In comparison to
# the private method it can access the other car method to compare it but it
# is not gonna expose it. With private method we couldn't access the other car's
# value.
