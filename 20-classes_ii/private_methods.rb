#  the problem is that we can also access the production_number externally
# e.g. using the generate_production_number method. In that case we can
# generate 2 production_numbers for 1 object. We don't want the generate_
# production_number method to be exposed and available publically. We want to
# make that method private. Making it private means that we cannot call it
# on an object. It is still available inside and other instance methods that we
# call on the object have access to this method.
