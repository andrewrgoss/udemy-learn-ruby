# Monkey patching offers to the process modifying or adding features to the
# exisiting class. Even after we have a class definition we can later reopen it
# and add new things e.g. new instance methods to the class definition. In fact,
# Ruby is so flexible that it allows to make changes to its own exisiting classes
# like hashes, strings or arrays.

# e.g. we can add a new instance method to the Array class but we have to be
# careful here as if we define an instance method with a name that already
# exists within that class, we will overwrite it.

class Array
  def sum
    total = 0
    each { |element| total += element if element.is_a?(Numeric) }
    total
  end
  # self refers to the array we will call the method on, e.g. later we will create
  # an array [1, 2, 3] and self will refer to that.
end

p [1, 'Hello', 2, false, 3, 4].sum # we can call this sum method on this array
# as we have validated this method and it's goinf to add only numeric objects,
# other objects will be omitted.

  def alphabet_sum
    alphabet = ('a'..'z').to_a
    sum = 0
    downcase.each_char do |character|
      next unless alphabet.include?(character)

      numeric_value = alphabet.index(character) + 1 # we add 1 as Ruby starts
      # counting at 0 and we want the last character to have index position
      # number 26 not 25
      sum += numeric_value
    end
    sum
  end
end

puts 'abc'.alphabet_sum # we get 6 as a is 1, b is 2 and c is 3
puts 'zzz'.alphabet_sum # we get 78 which is 26 + 26 + 26
