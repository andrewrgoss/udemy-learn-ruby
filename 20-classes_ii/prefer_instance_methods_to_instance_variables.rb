    # instead of calling instance variable (@production_number)
    # we call instance method (self.production_number). It will trigger
    # the intstance method which will then access the instance variable.
    # when we're dealing with getters, we can even simplify the process
    # further removing the self keyword because Ruby will intuitively know
    # to look for an instance method in the same object. However, we cannot do
    # that with self.class as after removing self keyword we will get only
    # class word which is a built-in Ruby keyword, and Ruby will get confused
    # about that. It is preferred to use instance methods over the instance
    # variables as we call the value of this method directly and we can
    # easily alter the presentation of the result.
