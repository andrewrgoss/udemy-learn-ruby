# The yield keyword transfers control from the method to the block that is
# attached to the method call. When we have a yield keyword the method stops
# execution and waits until the block is done executing whatever is within it.
# !If we use the yield keyword, Ruby is expecting a block with the method call!
# If we don't provide this block, we're going to get an error.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Blocks implicitly return the last evaluation back to the method that calls them.
# Because the return is implicit, we may not call the return keyword in a block
# as we'll get an error.

def pass_control

pass_control do
  puts 'This is the first line of the block.'
  puts 'Yey, still inside the block.'

def who_am_I
  adjective = yield
  puts "I'm very #{adjective}"
end

who_am_I { 'handsome' }
# because "handsome" is the last evaluation within a block it's going to be an
# implicit return. Just like the last evaluation of a method is going to serve
# as the implicit return of the method, whatever is the last evaluation within
# a block serves as the official return value.

# Multiple yields within a method:
def multiple_pass
  puts 'Inside the method'
  yield
  puts 'Back inside the method'
  yield
