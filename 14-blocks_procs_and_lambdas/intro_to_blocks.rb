# Review of blocks:
#
#  - A block is a collection of code to be executed
#  - A block is NOT an object in Ruby
#  - Blocks must be attached to a method call as it cannot exist
#    without a corresponding method
#  - Blocks alter the execution of the method
#  - A block is NOT an argument/parameter to the method
#  - Blocks can be defined with {} or do end
#  - A block can get or update the value of local variables within a block
#
# ------------------METHODS vs. BLOCKS-----------------------
#
#  - Methods can be invoked over and over
#  - In comparison, a block will only be called once, then disappears
#  - A block isilates actions away from the method
#   EXAMPLE: each
#    [3, 5, 7, 9].each {|num| puts num ** 2}
#
evens = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
evens.each { |number| puts number**3 }

colors = %w[red purple green blue]
statements = colors.map { |color| "#{color} is a great color!" }
p statements

5.times do |index|
  puts index
  puts "Let's move on to the next loop."
end
