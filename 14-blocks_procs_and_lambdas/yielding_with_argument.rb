# Yielding with an argument to pass to the block:

speak_the_truth { |name| puts "#{name} is brilliant!" }
# in the block we provide a varaible name representing the word
# "Boris". The "Boris" string is going to be passed to the block,
# the block is going to define it as the name block variable
# and then it is going to interpolate it in the string in the block.

speak_the_truth { |name| puts "#{name} is incredible" }

def speak_the_truth(name)

# we may specify variable in the method and then provide the string
# "Boris" as an argument to the method call as above.  In this way it
# is easier to modify the argument.
speak_the_truth('Sarah') { |name| puts "#{name} is brilliant!" }

# If we provide more variables in the block than in the method,
# Ruby is going to return the nil in place of non-exisiting value.
speak_the_truth('Sarah') { |name, age| puts "#{name} is #{age} years old!" }
# to prove that:
speak_the_truth('Sarah') do |name, age|

  p age
