# Instead of duplicating the above blocks we can create a proc.
# The difference between the block and proc is that a block is not an object.
# We may not call a method on it or save it to a variable and it's basically
# gone as soon as the method calling it is done executing.
# Procs are designed to be reused. They do not care about the arguments
# and are entirely self-contained.

# Creating a proc we should assign it to a variable:
cubes = proc { |number| number**3 }
# squares = Proc.new {|number| number **2}
a_cubes = a.map(&cubes) # instead of providing a block in here, we provide a proc
# which is marked by the ampersand
# b_cubes = b.map(&squares)
