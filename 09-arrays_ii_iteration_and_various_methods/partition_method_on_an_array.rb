# the partition method calls the select and reject methods in one step
# at the same time and gives back a multidimensional array of 2 arrays where
# the first one represents those that are selected and
# the second one represents all that are rejected.
foods = ['steak', 'vegetables', 'steak burger', 'kale', 'tofu', 'tuna steak']
good = foods.select { |food| food.include?('steak') }
bad = foods.reject { |food| food.include?('steak') }
p good
p bad

# but I can do the above using only 1 method:

p foods.partition { |food| food.include?('steak') }
# the result we get in one array but consisting of 2 subarrays (see the runner)

# to unpack this multidimensional array that we have just got we may assign it
# as follows:
good, bad = p foods.partition { |food| food.include?('steak') }

p good
p bad
