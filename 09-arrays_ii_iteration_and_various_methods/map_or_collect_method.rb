# .map or .collect methods are used when we want to create a new array which
# will be the result of applying some kind of operation to every single
# element in another array. Both methods return back a brand new array with
# that operation.

# with .map method don't have to create a new empty array and then push
# the result to it. See below:
numbers.map { |number| number**2 }
# I can assign the result of the above to the variable:
squares = numbers.map { |number| number**2 }

end
# printing the above without assigning it to a new variable we get
# the enumerator. See the runner window.
celsius_temperatues = fahr_temperatures.map do |temp|
  minus32 = temp - 32
  minus32 * (5.0 / 9.0)
end

# replacing the .map with the .collect method:

celsius_temperatues = fahr_temperatures.collect do |temp|
  minus32 = temp - 32
  minus32 * (5.0 / 9.0)
end

# we get exactly the same result. There is no difference between these
# 2 methods.

# puts within a block of .map and .collect methods:
# results = [1, 2, 3].map {|number| puts number **2}
# p results
# if we put "puts" within a block with these mehods we get a nil value that is
# why we need to avoid doing so.

# new array will have all the values from the original one cubed.
