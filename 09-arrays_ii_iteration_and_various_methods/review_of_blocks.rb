3.times # this method requires a block - collection/chunk of code that
# modifies how the method performs. There are 2 ways of providing
# a block: curly braces (used with 1-line code) or do and end which
# is executed when we have multiple lines of code

3.times { puts 'Hello there' } # returns ""Hello there" 3 times
# we can also create a block variable inside a block putting it
# in vertical pipes

3.times { |number| puts "I'm currently on loop number #{number}" }
# block variable represents the current iteration or the current
# loop I'm on within my .times method.
# Iterations in Ruby start counting at 0.

5.times do |number|
  square = number * number
  puts "The current number is #{number} and its square is #{square}"
end

# the block variable can be used only within a block. If we try to call it
# outside the block, we will get an error as anything that exists within
# a block is gone as soon as the method that calls that block is done
# executing.
# puts square - triggers an error
