p /m/ =~ phrase # this combination works fine as well
p phrase =~ /!/
p phrase =~ /./ # means find any character at all - special combination
# for regular expression
p phrase =~ / / # returns the first space
p phrase =~ /x/ # if there is no character "x", we get nils
p phrase =~ /Ru/ # with the multiple characters it returns the index position
# of the first character
# we need to watch out for special characters as sometimes they mean something
# completely different than we would expect
