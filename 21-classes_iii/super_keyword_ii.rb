# There are three ways we can call the super keyword:
# - super without parentheses - calls the whole super method
# - super with parentheses but no arguments - calls the super method
#  not passing to it any arguments from the subclass
# - super with parentheses and with arguments

# super() means call the super method but don't pass to it any of the
# arguments as if we add an argument only in the subclass and don't
# use empty parentheses, we will get an error. In this case we want
# to use the speed argument only with the subclass method.
