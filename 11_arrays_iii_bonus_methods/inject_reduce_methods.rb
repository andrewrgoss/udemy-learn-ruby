# These two methods are exactly the same and commonly used in Ruby.
# They are used whenever we iterate over an array and we need to keep track
# of some kind of operation or computation from all elements prior to
# the one that we're currently on e.g. cumulative sum:
# a, b, c = a + a+b + a+b+c - see below:
#

# [10, 20, 30, 40].reduce(0) # 0 argument specifies the starting value
# pevious represents the result of the previous calculation
# current represents the current element I'm on

result = [10, 20, 30, 40].reduce(0) do |previous, current|
  puts "The previous value is #{previous}"
  puts "The current value is #{current}"
  previous + current
end

p result

puts

result_1 = [15, 25, 35, 45].inject(0) do |previous, current|
  puts "The previous value is #{previous}"
  puts "The current value is #{current}"
  previous + current
end

p result_1

puts
# Rolling product: going through the below array and multiplying all
# the values together:
product = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].reduce(1) do |previous, current|
  puts "The previous value is #{previous}"
  puts "The current value is #{current}"
  previous * current
end

  puts "The previous value is #{previous}"
