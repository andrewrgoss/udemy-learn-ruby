#!/usr/bin/env ruby

# time in Ruby is used to represent time, as well as, dates
# we have two options to create a time object:
today = Time.new # Time.now is identical to Time.new if it's used
# without any argument
p today
p today.class

# we use this whenever we want  to specify a specific day or time
p Time.new
p Time.new(2015) # we get the 1st of Jan 2015 at midnight
p Time.new(2015, 5) # as the 2nd argument we provide the month
p Time.new(2015, 5, 18) # as the 3rd argument we provide the day
p Time.new(2015, 5, 18, 7) # as the 4th argument we provide
# the hour
p Time.new(2015, 5, 18, 7, 30) # as the 5th argument we provide
# the minutes
p Time.new(2015, 5, 18, 7, 30, 12) # as the 6th argument we provide
# the seconds
